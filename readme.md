# VB Decompiler Plugin SDK for Free Pascal

This repository contains the official Plugin Development Kit (SDK) for [**VB Decompiler**](https://www.vb-decompiler.org), written in **Free Pascal**.

This SDK allows you to create native DLL plugins that interact directly with the VB Decompiler core, enabling you to analyze, modify, or extend the decompiled code and internal structures of the application.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Native Interop:** Full support for the VB Decompiler API using standard calling conventions.
*   **Complete API:** Wrappers for all available host functions (Project manipulation, GUI interaction, Code analysis).
*   **Example Project:** A ready-to-use plugin demonstrating text retrieval and UI integration.
*   **Unicode Support:** Correct handling of string conversions between the host and the plugin.

## 📋 Prerequisites

To build the plugin, you will need:

*   **VB Decompiler:** v12.0 or higher (to test the plugin).
*   **Compiler/IDE:**
    *   Lazarus IDE v2.2+ (32-bit).

## 🛠️ How to Build

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DotFixSoft/VBDecompilerPluginSDK_FPC.git
    ```

2.  Open the project in your IDE:
    *   Open `FPCPlugin.lpr` in Lazarus.

3.  Build the project (Select **Release** configuration and **32-bit/x86** target)

4.  The resulting `.dll` file will be generated in the output directory.

## 📦 Installation

To install your compiled plugin:

1.  Navigate to your VB Decompiler installation folder.
2.  Open the `plugins` directory.
3.  Copy your compiled `.dll` file into this folder.
4.  Restart VB Decompiler. Your plugin will appear in the **Plugins** menu.

## 📖 API Documentation
